This is a scrapper app for Trulia that creates copy pastable data in the format of an airtable for tracking Real Estate listings. This uses a bookmarklet to trigger the scraping and the data transformation and allows me to paste it into an airtable with one click. This is a quick and dirty method that was the fastest balance between saving time from data entry and building something quickly that accomplished my goal. 

One area that was causing problems was adding images. There was the option to download and then upload them but the easiers and fastest solution was to simply send the img url to an alert that I could copy from manually. This added just a few extra clicks and saved me from a much more complex bit of code that would have been inefficient time wise and cost wise to build out.
